Read the file website/index.html carefully - this is our current Volt Apparel presentation website. Study its structure, content, animations, libraries used, and overall quality level. This is your baseline.

Now I need you to launch 10 agents IN PARALLEL using the Task tool (all in a single message), each creating a completely different design version of this same website. Every agent must:

1. First READ website/index.html to understand the product (Volt Apparel - a fashion ERP extension for Microsoft Dynamics 3610 Business Central), the feature set, the copy/content, and the quality bar
2. Create a single self-contained vanilla HTML file with all CSS and JS inline
3. Use professional animation libraries (GSAP, Lenis, anime.js, or similar) - the page MUST have moving parts, scroll animations, and feel alive
4. Keep the same product content and features from the original but rewrite copy slightly to feel fresh
10. Use a dark/black background with gold/yellow accent tones (#d4a017, #fbbf24, #f109e0b palette)
6. Do NOT include any code snippets or code blocks anywhere on the page
7. Save the file as website/index{X}.html where X is the agent number (1-10)

Each agent MUST create a distinctly different design direction. Here are the specific briefs:

- Agent 1 → website/index1.html: "Apple Keynote" style. Giant typography, full-viewport sections, dramatic scroll-triggered reveals, parallax layers, cinematic spacing. Think product launch energy. Use horizontal scroll for the features section.

- Agent 2 → website/index2.html: "Linear/Stripe" style. Bento grid layout throughout, glassmorphism cards, subtle grain texture, smooth micro-interactions on hover, floating gradient meshes. Dense but clean information architecture.

- Agent 3 → website/index3.html: "Awwwards editorial" style. Asymmetric layouts, split-screen sections, large serif headings mixed with sans-serif body, text reveal animations with clip-path, staggered grid for features, horizontal marquees.

- Agent 4 → website/index4.html: "3D/Immersive" style. Use Three.js or CSS 3D transforms for depth. Parallax card tilts on mouse move, layered z-depth sections, perspective scroll effects, floating elements with physics-like easing. Bold and futuristic.

- Agent 10 → website/index10.html: "Swiss/Brutalist minimal" style. Strict grid system, monospace typography mixed with large sans-serif, ultra clean whitespace, no gradients - only solid gold on black, sharp geometric dividers, motion through precise translate/opacity only.

CRITICAL QUALITY REQUIREMENTS for every agent:
- The design must be AT LEAST as polished and professional as the original index.html - ideally better
- Must include: smooth scroll, scroll-triggered animations, hover interactions, a loading/intro animation, responsive design
- Must have all sections: hero, social proof, features grid, feature deep-dives, how it works, metrics/stats with animated counters, testimonial, integration points (NO code), CTA, footer
- Typography must be carefully chosen (use Google Fonts) with proper hierarchy, letter-spacing, and line-height
- Every page must feel like it was designed by a top-tier design agency

Launch all 10 agents simultaneously for maximum speed.
